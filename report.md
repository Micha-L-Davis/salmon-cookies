# JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Next.js

### Research Conducted By: Andres, Brady, Micha

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 7
#### General Comments
Generally easy to convert a project. Built-in components are few, and vanilla CSS is *generally* compatible with those.

#### Pros
* Lightweight, few built-in components
* Highly customizable
* More efficient media presentation

#### Cons
* Image component requirements are a little work intensive
* It seems like nesting flex-boxes is not possible.

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
Initially seemed good for built in components, but didn't end up being super helpful for other aspects. 6/10

#### Systems Requirements
Next only requires the `next` package in a React project, and has no other dependencies.

#### Ramp-Up Projections
Ramp up should take no more than a day or two to increase familiarity.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
Next is highly popular and well supported.
